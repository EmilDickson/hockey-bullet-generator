# hockey-bullet-generator
A script that takes hockey statistics for two teams and generate xml files for them

# Who is this for?
This will basically only make sense for graphics operators at Statnet, working with the SHL.

# What do I do with it?
Run the script (i.e. navigate to the folder and):
```
python3 bullet-s.py
```
Then choose between two options:
1. Automatically generate bullets for a given game (follow the instructions)
2. Generate bullets from a carefully formatted .csv file:
   - Fields need to be: Team logo, Name/team name/headline, Text field 1, Text field 2

Always check that the information is correct before using these.
